# Notepad++ for macOS

**The first native port of Notepad++ to macOS.** A full port of the original [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) codebase — not a rewrite, not an alternative, not Wine.

## What this is

Notepad++ for macOS brings the beloved Windows code editor to Apple's desktop platform as a **fully native Mac application**. This is the actual Notepad++ codebase ported to run natively on macOS — built from source in Objective-C++, using platform-native APIs, with no compatibility layer in between.

- ✅ **Native macOS app** — no Wine, Porting Kit, CrossOver, or emulation
- ✅ **Universal Binary** — runs natively on Apple Silicon (M1–M5) and Intel
- ✅ **Apple-notarized** — ships signed and approved for macOS Gatekeeper
- ✅ **Free and open source** — GPL-3.0, no ads, no subscriptions, no telemetry
- ✅ **Full feature parity** — syntax highlighting, plugins, macros, find-in-files, regex, split view, document map, and more

The goal is not just to make Notepad++ "run" on Mac — it's to make it feel like it *belongs* there, with native menus, shortcuts, file dialogs, dark mode, and system integration.

## FAQ

### Is this the "real" Notepad++ for Mac?

Yes. This is the actual Notepad++ codebase ported to run natively on macOS. It is not an alternative, a knockoff, a Wine wrapper, or a new editor that imitates Notepad++. It's Notepad++.

### Do I need Wine, Porting Kit, or CrossOver?

No. None of those. Notepad++ for macOS is a full native port of the original Windows codebase. It runs as a first-class native macOS application using platform APIs directly.

### Does it work on Apple Silicon?

Yes. Notepad++ for macOS is built as a Universal Binary with native ARM64 support. It runs at full speed on all Apple Silicon Macs without Rosetta translation.

### Is it free?

Yes. Completely free and open source under the GPL-3.0 license. No ads, no subscriptions, no in-app purchases, no telemetry.

### Does it support plugins from the Windows version?

Plugins are being incrementally ported from Windows. About 50 plugins are already ported and working on macOS, with the full set (~140) expected by the end of April 2026. See the [plugin compatibility page](https://notepad-plus-plus-mac.org/plugins/) for current status.

## Building from Source

This project is written in C++ and Objective-C++ and uses CMake as its build system. Source code lives in `src/`, and platform-native UI code uses `.mm` files (Objective-C++).

Build instructions will be published as the macOS build pipeline matures. For now, the easiest way to use Notepad++ on macOS is to download the signed `.dmg` release.
